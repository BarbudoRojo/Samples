This is a package for allowing full text search on terms associated with a key. An example would be an application
that wants to index on the name field of a customer. The application should iterate over all entries and
call Index#insert after creating a Map with entry pairs consisting of the customer id and the name field. Later,
the application can use the index to retrieve the customer ids for all entries whose name includes
a particular string. The application needs to ensure the index is maintained as the main map changes. The
insert and remove methods allow this. An update is simply a remove followed by an insert.
<p/>
The testog.xml file includes templates which must be present in your objectgrid.xml file and deployment.xml. The
actual maps used for the index are automatically created using these templates. Make sure your objectgrid servers
include this package and wxsutils on their classpath as well as the key classes you use for the index.
