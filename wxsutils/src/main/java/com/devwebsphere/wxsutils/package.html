This package contains the WXSUtils class which is used to implement high performance bulk and agent operations from a
WebSphere eXtreme Scale client. It also provides a simplified, non transactional, thread safe interface to the
grid APIs using runtime exceptions. This is an easier interface than the normal transactional, session based interface to grid
maps  but you lose certain operations around locking and transactions.
<p/>
If you are using WXSUtils in a WAR module then be sure to add the WXSUtilsServletListener as a listener in your
web.xml to ensure it's cleaned up properly.
