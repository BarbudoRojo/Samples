This is a criteria style API to filter POJOs.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
The easiest way to think of it is an expression or filter that can check if a VALUE matches a boolean expression or not. 
The expression can consist of relational and logical statements about attributes of the value.

The first thing to realize is that this is generic. It works with or without WebSphere eXtreme Scale. The value doesn't 
need to be a POJO, it can be anything so long as a way to extract the named attributes is also provided.<p/>
<h3>Usage</h3>
Lets assume you have a Customer POJO with a first name and surname attributes available as public fields. We want to write
a filter that checks if the Customer is "Billy Newport". We first construct the filter like this:
<pre>
		FilterBuilder fb = new FilterBuilder();
		ValuePath fn = new PojoPropertyPath("FirstName");
		ValuePath sn = new PojoFieldPath("surname");
		
		Filter f = fb.and(fb.eq(fn, "Billy"), fb.eq(sn, "Newport"));
		
		Assert.assertEquals(f.filter(c), true);
</pre>
Here, you can see us create the Filter using the FilterBuilder. We create two Path objects that know given a Customer
how to extract the FirstName and surname attributes. FirstName is extracted using the getter method, surname using the
field directly. Notice capitalization is important here. The field approach also requires public fields for now.<p/>
Next, we code up "x.firstName == 'Billy' && x.surname == 'Newport'" using the FilterBuilder. The FilterBuilder returns
a Filter directly that can be used to then check if an object works with the filter. Note, this would work with any POJO
so long as it had two correctly named attributes. The Filter is also serializable and so can be easily send around the network
or stored in a WXS Map.<p/>
The filter can be easily then used to check a POJO by simply providing the POJO instance to the Filter#filter method.
