This package contains ValuePath implementations.
<h3>Introduction</h3>
ValuePath is the abstraction used by the filtering to eliminate any dependency on the structure of the object being
filtered. ValuePath implementations are provided for Java objects using reflection but the values could also
be XML/JSON/Thrift/Avro or any format so long as an appropriate ValuePath implementation can be created to
extract a named attribute from it.
