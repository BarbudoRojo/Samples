This allows a query to run against all data inside a DataGrid.
The GridQuery instance wraps a JobExecutor and allows a specific query to be executed against all data in the grid. The query
is reexecuted each time getNextResult is called and another subset of the result is returned. Thus if there are 10 partitions
with 500 records each and a simple query is executed to retrieve each record. If GridQuery was initialized to return
100 records at a time then the query would be executed 5 times per partition. Each time the following block of records
is returned to getNextResult as an ArrayList. First, records from 0..99 come back, then 100..199 comes back and so on. Thus
the query would be executed 5 times per partition times 10 partitions or 500 times. Thus, the query if it will be executed
a lot should be efficient. The query is also stateless. No per query state is kept on the grid side at all.<p/>
Here is an example of its usage:

<pre>
GridQuery q = new GridQuery(ogclient, "select p from Person p", 100);
ArrayList<Object> block = q.getNextResult();
while(block != null)
{
	for(Object r : block)
	{
		Person p = (Person)r;
		System.out.println(p.toString());
		Assert.assertEquals(true, personSet.remove(p.getFirstName()));
	}
	block = q.getNextResult();
}
</pre>
This will pull all records from the map Person to the client in blocks of 100 entries. The ArrayList returned from getNextResult
can have no elements in it. This does not mean the query is complete. Only a null value indicates the end. The application
should keep calling getNextResult until it returns null.
