This is a package to make running sequential operations on all data in a grid easier.
This framework basically lets you easily run a piece of code (SinglePartTask) within two provided nested loops. The outer loop has one
iteration for each partition in the grid. The inner loop runs your code within the primary shard for the current partition
until your code indicates that it is finished with the data in the partition. The JobExecutor is the users view of these
loops. The loops are transparent to the user. The user simply calls JobExecutor.getNextResult and the looping is handled. The
first time its called then the first partition is selected and the SinglePartTask is called to work on the first block of data
in the partition. Each subsequent call to getNextResult should cause SinglePartTask to run against the next block and return
a value for that until finally the last block for the partition is handled. The next call to getNextResult will then cause
JobExecutor to move to the next partition and then loop over all blocks there in the same manner. Finally, all partitions
are visited and then getNextResult will return null.<p/>
An example of a SinglePartTask could be a simple query as in the "com.devwebsphere.wxsutils.multijob.ogql.GridQuery". Here the
user specifies an object query expression and this statement is executed in each partition and a sequential subset of results
in returned.
