This package has code to dump a grid based map to local JSON formatted files and the load them back again.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
If a large dataset has been copied or preloaded in to a grid then typically this can take some time. We have seen
customers take hours to get data in to the grid. The bottleneck is ALWAYS the source system, not the grid. Once the
data is in the grid then no body wants to bring the grid down given the cost of loading everything back again. This
code provides a simple way to dump or create a snapshot of the data currently in the grid to the grid local file system.
Each container in the grid will write a file for each partition and store the whole partition in this file. We provide
another code segment to allow this data to be reloaded from the local file system after the grid can been restarted. This
is useful to reduce down-time when performing maintenance that requires restarting the whole grid or it could be used to
schedule periodic dumps that could be used for a faster restart to those known points in the event the grid went down. This
can also be used in development to preload a grid to a known state for testing purposes quickly.
<h3>File format</h3>
Each container creates one file per partition in a well known folder on the box hosting the container JVM. The file is
named after the partition and map. The first line of the file is a magic text sequence. The second line is the partition
number and the third line is the mapname. The next two lines are the Java class names for the key and value classes in the Map.
Each entry is then written to the file with two lines for each entry. The first line is the JSON encoded key, the second line
is the JSON encoded value.
<h3>Ensuring one container per box only loads the snapshot</h3>
We use a simple file lock to ensure that when multiple container JVMs are present on a box, only one
will actually load the snapshot files on that box. The lock has a .lock postfix and is named after the
time the client asked for the snapshot to be read. Every time a client does a new read from snapshot a
new lock file name is generated so we don't need to worry about old lock files stopping new read from
snapshot requests.
