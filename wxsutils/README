This module has some utility classes for customers using IBM WebSphere eXtreme Scale. 
The maven pom module includes some special profiles to make getting going easier.

This command will start a catalog server on the box. It's bound to localhost so it will only work
for local container JVMs. You can change localhost to the real hostname in the pom.xml for a 'proper'
hostname

mvn test -PstartSingleCatalog -e

Note in application server environments
You should configure wxsutils.jar to be a shared jar referenced by the WAR or EAR modules.

To build without running test cases use:

mvn install -DskipTests=true

You MUST add the following templates to your objectgrid.xml and deployment.xml files if you use
the List/Set support

<!-- You need to define these templates for Lists and Sets -->
	<backingMap name="LHEAD.*" template="true" lockStrategy="PESSIMISTIC"  copyMode="COPY_TO_BYTES" lockTimeout="20"/>
	<backingMap name="LBUCK.*" template="true" lockStrategy="PESSIMISTIC"  copyMode="COPY_TO_BYTES" lockTimeout="20"/>
	<backingMap name="LDIRTY.*" template="true" lockStrategy="PESSIMISTIC"  copyMode="COPY_TO_BYTES" lockTimeout="20"/>
<!-- End of List/Set templates -->
