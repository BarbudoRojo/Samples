This module has some utility classes for customers using IBM WebSphere eXtreme Scale. 
The maven pom module includes some special profiles to make getting going easier.

This command will start a catalog server on the box. It's bound to localhost so it will only work
for local container JVMs. You can change localhost to the real hostname in the pom.xml for a 'proper'
hostname

mvn test -PstartSingleCatalog -e

Note in application server environments
You should configure wxsutils.jar to be a shared jar referenced by the WAR or EAR modules.

To build without running test cases use:

mvn install -DskipTests=true
