The main class here is the MyKey class. This shows how to override the routing for this key and look up
how a specific key should be routed based on a database table which manually specifies which partition
owns which keys. This allows customers to use business rules rather than a uniform mathematical hash
to specify which partitions own which keys. This can be important when certain keys get a lot more requests
than others, for example, stocks in a trading system.

The PartitionMapping POJO uses JPA read the desired partition for a key from a database table.
