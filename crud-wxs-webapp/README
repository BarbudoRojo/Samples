This is an example web app using wxsutils to implement a simple web client that allows
get/put and remove operations against a grid.

The grid to use is specified in the wxsutils.properties file in main/resources. The wxsutils.properties
provided in the project will create a grid within the servlet container by default. Provide the
cep to the remote grid if you want to connect to a remote grid.

The URLs are: (I'm assuming the context for the application is "grid" and it's on port 80)

http://host/grid/get.jsp?key=Billy&map=MAP

This will fetch the value for the key "Billy" from the map called "MAP". All values are assumed
to be strings in this demo.

http://host/grid/put.jsp?key=Billy&value=USA&map=MAP

This stores the value "USA" under the key "Billy" in the map "MAP".

http://host/grid/remove.jsp?key=Billy&map=MAP

This removes the entry for the key "Billy" from the map "MAP".

If you are deploying this webapp on WebSphere then make sure the web container is using Java 5 for
the JSP compiler otherwise you will get errors. More information on how to configure is at this link:

I'm assuming the WebSphere instance hosting this webapp has WXS already installed on top of it before you
try to run this application. If you're on a non IBM web container then just put the objectgrid.jar
or ogclient.jar in the webapp also. You can do this by changing the scope in the pom.xml to compile rather
than provided.
