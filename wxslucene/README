This is an Apache Lucene Directory implementation using IBM WebSphere eXtreme Scale as a storage device. 
The GridDirectory class can be used to attach to a remote grid and then copy a disk based Lucene index to it. The
ClientGridDirectory lets you easily attach to a working grid with an index already loaded.

The Directory is configured usually using two properties files on the root class path. wxsutils.properties is used
to connect to the grid and wxslucene.properties is used to configure the directory. Examples of these can be
found in the src/test/resources folder.
