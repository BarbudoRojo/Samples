This package has the important classes to use the prototype. The grid is defined by the objectgrid.xml and deployment.xml
in the resources directory. The grid uses an SQL database to store the data permanently. It's currently configured
to use mysql. The DDL to create the mysql database is in the resources directory. The database connection attributes
are in the objectgrid.xml file.
<p/>
The data stored in the database is read in to the grid lazily and updated asynchronously using write behind. This means
you can't stop the grid until the write behind has finished writing any pending changes.
<p/>
Clients that want to use the grid should use the R class as their only interface to it. They should call the initialize
method providing the catalog service end points as its parameter. The R class has static methods to access typed Maps
which allow you to read/write to those typed maps.
