This is a simple thrift gateway for WXS. The gateway runs as a J2SE application. You run one and then thrift clients can connect
to the gateway and the gateway forwards the requests to a WXS behind the gateway. The wxsutils.properties file configured
which grid the gateway will connect to.

The operations supported are get/getAll, put/putAll, remove/removeAll. Each verb takes a map name as a parameter. The gateway
automatically creates maps for any map names so you shouldn't need to edit any of the xml files to get started.

Just start a WXS grid using the objectgrid.xml and deployment.xml in the test/resources folder. You can edit the deployment.xml
to change partition count, replicas and so on.

Next, start the gateway application

Next, start your clients and connect to the gateway. The src/test/java folder has the TestAPIs test case for an example
of a Java client.
