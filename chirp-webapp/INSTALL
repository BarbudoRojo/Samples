Follow the instructions for wxsutils and redis-wxs. The redis-wxs creates the database for this example. The redis database
schema is constant so that schema works for the chirp storage.

Once everything is compiled and built, i.e. do a mvn install for wxsutils and then do it for redis-wxs. Next, build chirp-webapp.

Start a test redis server using:

cd redis-wxs
mvn test -PsingleServerGrid

Make sure your mysql database is running and that you have created the chirp database (see instructions in redis-wxs).

cd ../chirp-webapp
mvn jetty:run

Now, open a browser and goto http://localhost:8080/chirp-webapp

Register and then chirp/tweet away. Others can login also and it works very much like twitter.
