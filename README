This is a collection of source code written by Billy Newport at IBM. It's primarily a dump of sample code that I've written for customers over the years and as such contains a lot of patterns that are the best way to do various things
with IBM WebSphere eXtreme Scale.

The wxsutils package is a collection of help wrappers for WXS that I always use for samples. It makes WXS even easier to use and even improves performance for quite a few scenarios. If you use WXS then I recommend for simple CRUD cache style applications that you use WXS with wxsutils on top.

Almost all the code is, of course, owned by IBM and it is provided using the WXS sample code license which makes it free to use for IBM customers. Read the license for more details.

The remainder of the code is as follows:
wxsutils/NamedParameterStatement.java

All source files are clearly marked with ownership. The vast majority have an IBM sample license on them.

I am actively maintaining this codebase so please use it and open an issues on this site. However, this code is not supported/maintained by IBM and I maintain it as I have time to do so.

I reserve the right to remove this repository or stop maintaining it at any time so if you use it then make sure to pull the source code also so that you can build it independently of this repository.
